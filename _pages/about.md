<!--Start Intro-->
My name is Yufan Zhou (Chinese: Âë®Èõ®Âá°). I am an undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Weigang Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangweigang) and [Shuhui Wang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/shwang/). I have also done a research internship and visited students in Professor [Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) in WU, [Yan-Pei Cao](https://yanpei.me/) in VAST, [Xihui Liu](https://xh-liu.github.io/) in MMLab@HKU and [Xingang Pan](https://xingangpan.github.io/) in MMLab@NTU before.

<p>I am broadly interested in various software development technologies and diffusion theory, particularly in T2V (Text-to-Video), T2I (Text-to-Image), personalization generation, and projects involving procedural planning (e.g., Video Prediction).</p>

<p>Initially, my interest was in various diffusion works, aspiring to use generative skills to create anything. Currently, I focus more on image generation, such as personalization and data or dataset augmentation. My goal is to generate images in various styles and reduce the cost of data acquisition. I'm eager to connect with anyone who shares this vision for AI or appreciates the same research approach.</p>

<p>Recently, my interest has expanded to 3D generation and world-building, which I believe is the ultimate goal of diffusion and generative subjects. By enabling arbitrary editing styles of images, everyone can access resources and 3D worlds. Additionally, incorporating physical conditions into diffusion can make the generated results appear more realistic and logical. I am optimistic that this can be achieved soon, given that image generation began only a few years ago.</p>

<p>In addressing these issues, my focus is on what I do and aim to achieve. I believe that with logic, mathematics, and the creation of various architectures, one can accomplish anything.</p>
