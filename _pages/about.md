<img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1531849430/4246/blob-sunglasses.gif?1531849430" width="30" alt="Emoji"/>My name is Yufan Zhou (Chinese: Âë®Èõ®Âá°). I am an undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Weigang Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangweigang) and [Shuhui Wang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/shwang/). I have also done a research internship and visited students in Assistant Professor [Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/)‚Äôs ENCODE Lab (WestLake University) before.
<br />
I am broadly interested in various software development technologies and diffusion theory, particularly in T2V (Text-to-Video), T2I (Text-to-Image), personalization generation, and projects involving procedural planning (e.g., Video Prediction).

Initially, my interest was in various diffusion works, aspiring to use generative skills to create anything. Currently, I focus more on image generation, such as personalization and data or dataset augmentation. My goal is to generate images in various styles and reduce the cost of data acquisition. I'm eager to connect with anyone who shares this vision for AI or appreciates the same research approach.

Recently, my interest has expanded to 3D generation and world-building, which I believe is the ultimate goal of diffusion and generative subjects. By enabling arbitrary editing styles of images, everyone can access resources and 3D worlds. Additionally, incorporating physical conditions into diffusion can make the generated results appear more realistic and logical. I am optimistic that this can be achieved soon, given that image generation began only a few years ago.

In addressing these issues, my focus is on what I do and aim to achieve. I believe that with logic, mathematics, and the creation of various architectures, one can accomplish anything.

# üìù Papers in "Procedure Planning in Video Prediction"

## Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos

**Yufan Zhou**, Zhaobo Qi, Lingshuai Lin, Jungi Jing, Tingting Chai, Beichen Zhang, Shuhui Wang, Weigang Zhang

- Focus on goal-directed plans in instructional videos using current visual observations.
- Propose a latent space temporal logical interpolation module within the diffusion model for intermediate supervision.
- Use an interpolator with transformer encoder blocks to guide the diffusion model using start and end observation features.
- Implement a masking strategy and task-adaptive masked proximity loss to ensure action accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key metrics.

# üìñ Internships

- *2024.05 - 2024.11*, Research Intern at ENCODE LAB, WestLake University. Advised by Prof. Huan Wang

# üíª Software Projects

I enjoy creating software for fun and exploring new technologies, such as Vue, Spring Boot, Android, and other tech stacks. I have completed several projects using these technologies, which have enhanced my technical skills, project management abilities, and experience in requirement analysis. Additionally, I hope my library can assist others in learning and applying code for their needs and research.
